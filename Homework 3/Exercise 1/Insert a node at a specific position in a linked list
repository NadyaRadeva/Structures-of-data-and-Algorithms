Given a pointer to the head node of a linked list and an integer to insert at a certain position, create a new node with the given integer as its data attribute, insert this node at the desired position, and return the head node.
A position of 0 indicates the head, a position of 1 indicates one node away from the head, and so on. The head pointer given may be null, meaning that the initial list is empty.


Example
'head' refers to the first node in the list 1->2->3
data = 4
position = 2

Insert a node at position 2 with data = 4. The new list is 1->2->4->3.

Function Description
Complete the function 'insertNodeAtPosition' with the following parameters:
- SinglyLinkedListNode pointer llist: a reference to the head of the list
- data: an integer value to insert as data in the new node
- position: an integer position to insert the new node, zero-based indexing

Returns
SinglyLinkedListNode pointer: a reference to the head of the revised list

Input Format
The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in the linked list.
Each of the next  lines contains an integer SinglyLinkedListNode[i].data.
The next line contains an integer data, the data of the node that is to be inserted.
The last line contains an integer position.

Constraints
 - 1 <= n <= 1000, where  is the  element of the linked list.
 - 1 <= SinglyLinkedListNode[i].data <= 1000 where SinglyLinkedListNode[i] is the ith element of the linked list
 - 0 <= position <= n.

Sample Input
STDIN   Function
-----   --------
3       n = 3
16      llist = 16->13->7
13
7
1       data = 1
2       position = 2

Sample Output
16 13 1 7

Explanation
The initial linked list is 16->13->7. Insert 1 at the position 2 which currently has 7 in it. The updated linked list is 16->13->1->7.
